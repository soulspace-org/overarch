# Editor/IDE Integration
## Visual Studio Code

With the addition of a few extensions, Visual Studio Code is a lightweight
modelling environment.
Install the following extensions in VS Code:
![Calva Extension](/doc/images/vscode_calva_ext.png)
![PlantUML Extension](/doc/images/vscode_plantuml_ext.png)
![Graphviz Preview Extension](/doc/images/vscode_graphviz_preview_ext.png)
![Graphviz Language Extension](/doc/images/vscode_graphviz_language_ext.png)

With this setup you get an editor for the EDN files with code completion,
syntax check and syntax highlighting.

You also get integrated previews of the rendered PlantUML diagrams and the
ability to generate image files in different formats (e.g. PNG, SVG, PDF, ...)
directly from within Visual Studio Code.
