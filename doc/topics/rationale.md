# Rationale for Overarch
To model a system you can either use a modelling tool or a diagramming tool.
Most modelling tools are commercial and lock in your models.

Most diagramming tools don't use a model or don't separate the model information
from the layout. The scope of diagramming tools is very limited.

Overarch is free, open and extensible
* provides model information as plain data
* models are discoverable, composable, reusable
* model queries, vizualization, artifact generation
