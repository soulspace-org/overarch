# Exports

## JSON
The model and view descriptions can be exported to JSON to make their content
available to languages for which no EDN implementation exists.
The export converts each EDN file in the model directory to JSON.

## Structurizr (*experimental*)
Structurizr is a tool set created by Simon Brown.
The Structurizr export creates a workspace with the loaded model and views.

As Structurizr currently only supports the C4 architecture model and views,
only these elements will be included in the Structurizr workspace.
