# Overarch Usage Overview

The usage of Overarch is twofold. On the one hand, Overarch provides an open
data format to describe the concepts, functional requirements, architecture,
and design of software systems. On the other hand it is a tool to transform the
description into diagrams, reports or other representations.

Overarch can be used as a CLI tool to convert specified models and diagrams
into different formats, e.g. the rendering of diagrams in PlantUML or the
conversion of the data to JSON. It can also be used to query the model by
criteria and generate artifacts based on the result with templates.
