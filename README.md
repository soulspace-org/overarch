# Overarch
Overarch provides an ontology and a data driven model of software systems
and organizations based on e.g. UML and the C4 model.

Model your system as data and specify/generate representations (e.g.
diagrams) for your system. All core and supplementary C4 diagrams except code
diagrams are supported. Also UML use case, state machine and class diagrams
are supported.

Overarch is not so much about how to model your architecture (see
[C4 Model](https://c4model.com) for that), but about making these models
composable and reusable.

  * JSON if you need to process models with languages without EDN support
  * Structurizr *experimental*
* Watch model directories for changes

## Rationale
UML and C4 models are great to model and vizualize an architecture on different
levels of detail with the various diagrams types. The value lies in an
expressive description and visualization of an architecture with different
views.

But the models used for diagram generation with the existing diagram tools are
not models in the sense of generality. E.g. if you describe your model in
PlantUML files, these descriptions are mere textfiles. These textfiles don't
compose and you can't do anything else with these descriptions other than
render them with PlantUML. The parsing process is opaque and you don't have
access to the data of the model. Also the model is complected with the
diagrams, as layout and rendering information is part of the model description
and vice versa. The model should capture the essence of the architecture and
not its representation.

If the model is described as plain *data* in an open format, it can be
transformed into a graphical representation, e.g. into PlantUML textfiles, via
the specification of views on the model.

In Overarch the model data is separated from information about these
representations. Models can be composed with these views and with other models.
By doing so, the model may also be used in other ways, e.g. the generation of documentation, code or infrastructure.

Even if the model is specified as data, the format is a text file (EDN, JSON)
to be easily edited with text editors by the whole team and to be committed to version control, instead of being in some propriatory binary format.

The native format is the Extensible Data Notation (EDN) with representations
in other formats like JSON. EDN is a textual format for data, which is human
readable. It is also directly readable into data structures in clojure or java
code. The data format is also open for extension. E.g. it copes with additional attributes or element types in the data structures.

## Example
This is an example of the specification of a model and some diagrams based on
the Internet Banking System example of Simon Brown at [C4 Model](https://c4model.com).

The complete model and diagram specifications can be found under
[models/banking](/models/banking).

Further information about modelling with *Overarch* can be found in [Usage](doc/usage.md).

  :id :banking/personal-customer
  :name "Personal Banking Customer"
  :desc "A customer of the bank, with personal banking accounts."}
 ; system under design
{:el :system

### PlantUML export of the System Context View
```plantuml
@startuml context-view
!include <C4/C4_Context.puml>

## Example Models
Here are some Overarch example model repositories, containing the models and views and also the overarch and plantuml JARs and start scripts:

* [MyBank Model](https://github.com/soulspace-org/my-bank-model) 
  is a show case model of a banking organization.

* [Overarch Models](https://github.com/lsolbach/overarch-models)
  contains some personal models about concepts in software development, e.g. Domain Driven Design,  Cloud Computing, DORA State of DevOps or Clean Architecture.

## Installation
The general way of using Overarch is downloading the `overarch.jar` and 
`templates.zip` from the latest release on the [releases](https://github.com/soulspace-org/overarch/releases)
page and use them in your modelling project.

See [MyBank Model](https://github.com/soulspace-org/my-bank-model) for a simple
project layout and useful start scripts.

### Homebrew on macOS
This project has been packaged in Homebrew for macOS users. Install it using
```
brew install overarch
```

This package includes an `overarch` convenience wrapper which handles tracking
the location of the `overarch.jar` uberjar for you. This `overarch` command can
be substituted for the `java -jar overarch.jar` references throughout this
documentation.

### Visual Studio Code

If you have a clojure environment in some editor or IDE, just use it. Maybe a PlantUML plugin exists for this environment too.

If not, try Visual Studio Code with the **Calva** and **PlantUML** extensions.

![Calva Extension](/doc/images/vscode_calva_ext.png)
![PlantUML Extension](/doc/images/vscode_plantuml_ext.png)

With this setup you get an editor for the EDN files with code completion,
syntax check and syntax highlighting.

![Model editing](/doc/images/overarch_vscode_model.png)

You also get integrated previews of the exported PlantUML diagrams and the
ability to generate image files in different formats (e.g. PNG, SVG, PDF, ...)
directly from within Visual Studio Code.

![PlantUML preview](/doc/images/overarch_plantuml_preview.png)

PlantUML also needs an installation of [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).
Please read the installation instructions in the PlantUML extension on how to
install graphviz for your operating system.

To get support for icons (PlantUML sprites) from the PlantUML standard library, a recent **plantuml.jar** is highly recommended. Please download it from [PlantUML Releases](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases) and reference it in the PlantUML extension settings.

![PlantUML Extension Settings](/doc/images/vscode_plantuml_ext_settings.png)

## Usage
Use a folder for all the data (e.g. models, view specifications) of a project.
Add EDN files for the model and the view specifications. All the EDN files in the folder will be loaded.

### Command Line Interface
Start the the *Overarch* CLI tool with java.

```
java -jar overarch.jar [options]
```

For example to generate all views for the models with some debug output, use
```
java -jar ./target/overarch.jar -r all --debug
```

*Overarch* currently supports these options

```
Overarch CLI
   
   Reads your model and view specifications and renders or exports
   into the specified formats.

```

If you use Visual Studio Code as described above, you can start *Overarch* in watch mode from a terminal inside VS Code. Every time you save some changes in the EDN files, the views will be updated and previews can be rendered with the PlantUML extension.

## Documentation
See [Usage](doc/usage.md) for additional information on modelling and usage of the *Overarch* CLI tool.

See [Design](doc/design.md) for information about the design of *Overarch*.

## Build
Overarch is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and gets built with
[leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). To build it, you need to have Java 11 or higher
and leiningen installed.

In the cloned overarch repository, run

```
lein uberjar
```

to build a JAR file with all dependencies. This JAR file is created in the *target* folder and is named *overarch.jar*
