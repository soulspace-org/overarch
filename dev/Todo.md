## Modelling
* Answers to the following questions on different levels
  * What? (capabilities, use case goals, data? ...)
  * Why? (purpose, description?)
  * Who? (organizations, roles, use case actors)
  * With what/whom? (collaborations, supporting actors/systems, interfaces, artifacts)
  * How? (processes, use cases, scenarios/stories, sequences, activities, state machines, data?)
  * When? (events, triggers, timings, policies, state machines)
  * Where (locations, regions, deployment/infrastructure)
  * How good? (NFRs, quality metrics)
  * How long? (retentions, ...)
  * How configured? (parameters, environments)

* model/view config via edn?

## Export/Import
